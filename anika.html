      <p>NLP’s biggest, most famous application to date is ChatGPT. The platform’s popularity comes from its significant capabilities in answering questions about a broad range of fields. The article talks about how the NLP model can successfully accomplish many tasks such as multimodal analysis and integration, real time collaboration, learning from context, etc to provide human-like responses. It further goes on to indicate how these capabilities allow it to have a range of applications in the real world such as Visual Analysis, Image Analysis, Educational Support, Healthcare, etc. The article goes on to compare the performance of ChatGPT with other NLP models such as Meta’s LLaMA 3 and Google’s Gemini. They each improve on one of ChatGPT’s weaknesses. LLaMA 3 improves on ChatGPT’s lack of efficiency and scalability by incorporating complex algorithms that allow the platform to perform complex language tasks. Google’s Gemini is far superior at handling the ethical gaps left behind by ChatGPT. Its algorithm is geared towards bias reduction and creating a tool that upholds human morals. The article concludes talking about the scope for the future and potentially having a model that can improve upon the current limitations. </p>
      <h2><span class="badge text-bg-primary">Platform</span> Article Title</h3>
        <p>Java is a useful tool for NLP because of its versatility, efficiency and broad range of library support. It has a range of libraries specifically created to implement NLP. Apache OpenNLP, Stanford NLP and LingPipe are a few examples. These libraries provide fundamental tools for various NLP tasks like tokenization, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition, making development of complex models using java much easier. Additionally, it is also extremely scalable which allows developers to create models that handle large datasets and seamlessly integrate big data frameworks that enable the efficient analysis of massive amounts of data. Furthermore, java’s libraries allow developers to use complex statistical models and incorporate deep learning to create sophisticated language models that can tackle difficult NLP dilemmas. However, one of the best aspects of the platform is its easy integration with pre-trained deep learning models like BERT, GPT and ELMo. Already trained and fit on certain data, these models drastically reduce development time for coders, who do not need to carry the burden of building complex models from scratch. These pre-trained models are robust as they can be fine-tuned to the developer’s requirements through transfer learning. Hence, due to the diversity of functionality in its libraries, java is an excellent platform to implement Natural Language Processing in.

        <p>It is the process of breaking down text in smaller units. These smaller units are called tokens. These tokens can be words, phrases, or even characters depending on the model being used. An example of this is shown in the image. Here, the sentence is broken into words based on spaces by the tokenizer. This is a crucial step in NLP as it converts text into a format that algorithms can more easily analyze. This process helps algorithms understand word boundaries, punctuation and language patterns like humans do, forming the foundation for further analysis. Approaches to tokenization vary, some methods use spaces to split tokens while more complex ones break words into meaningful segments or rare unseen words. Although in most cases these methods are efficient, most tokenizing algorithms give rise to a few common problems. In some languages, there isn't a clear space between words, which makes creating tokens for those languages a lot harder. Hence, although a fundamental part of NLP, this process still has some challenges to be addressed. </p>
